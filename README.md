# Inventory-Management-System
Assume you are working on a new warehouse inventory management system named IMS. IMS will be responsible for the inventory tracking within physical, single site warehouses. IMS will track the named physical location of a product within the warehouse and the inventory level of each product. IMS can be deployed to busy warehouses supporting many pickers and restockers working with individual terminals and clients. Updates to inventory levels will be handled in real time to prevent pickers trying to pick a product that is out of stock. The application is a simple standalone application, that manages the inventory stored in the warehouse.
